## Statistical Tests

`bearings.R` contains the code for the statistical tests.

1. **Watson's test**: Checks for uniform distribution of directions.
2. **Watson's two-sample test**: Compares directional patterns between groups.
3. **Hermans-Rasson (HR) test**: A powerful test for circular uniformity.
4. **Rayleigh test**: Identifies significant mean directions.

These tests help determine:
- If there are preferred directions in movement
- If different groups (adults, weaners, particle traces) show distinct directional patterns
- If there are significant mean directions in the data
