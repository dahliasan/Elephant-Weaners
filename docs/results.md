Dispersal Analysis

We analyzed the dispersal patterns of 45 weaned elephant seal pups. The cumulative circular correlation between seal and particle bearings reached a maximum value (mean ± SD: 0.83 ± 0.36) after a median of 4 days (range: 2-180 days). A one-sample t-test revealed that the mean maximum correlation was significantly different from zero (t = 15.313, df = 44, p < 0.001), indicating a strong relationship between seal movements and ocean currents.

A significant negative correlation was found between the time to maximum correlation and the maximum correlation value (r = -0.39, p = 0.008), suggesting that seals achieving higher correlations with ocean currents did so more quickly.

The Generalized Additive Mixed Model (GAMM) revealed significant effects of both time since the start of the journey (F = 91.86, p < 0.001) and individual variation (F = 216.51, p < 0.001) on the correlation between seal and particle bearings. The model explained 68.8% of the variance in the data (R-sq.(adj) = 0.688).

Of the 45 seals analyzed, 32 (71.1%) were classified as "following" the prevailing currents, with their mean bearings within 45 degrees of the overall particle mean bearing. The mean bearing difference between seals and particles was 50.66 degrees (range: 1.81-218.68 degrees).

Survival Analysis

For first-trip survival, the best-fitting model included the predictors 'is_following' and 'sea surface temperature' (SST). The model selection process identified three top models with ΔAICc < 2, all of which included these two variables. Variable importance analysis revealed that SST (0.71) and 'is_following' (0.58) were the most important predictors of first-trip survival, followed by distance to ice edge (0.46).

Seals classified as following currents had a higher survival rate for the first trip (75.0%) compared to those not following currents (38.5%).

For first-year survival, the model selection process identified 22 models with ΔAICc < 2, indicating substantial model uncertainty. The top model included only sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) as a predictor. Variable importance analysis for first-year survival showed that weaning mass (0.56), SSHA (0.50), and 'is_following' (0.46) were the most important predictors.

Overall, 29 out of 45 seals (64.4%) survived their first trip, while 17 out of 45 (37.8%) survived their first year. These survival rates align with the contingency table data for 'is_following' and survival status.

These results suggest that both oceanographic factors and the tendency to follow currents play important roles in the dispersal and survival of weaned elephant seal pups, with different factors influencing survival over different time scales.
